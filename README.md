## Installation

The Docker image can be pulled from Docker Hub, here (ghcr.io) or Quay.io:

```sh
# Docker Hub
docker pull canardconfit/puppeteer-docker

# ghcr.io
docker pull ghcr.io/canardconfit/puppeteer-docker

# Quay.io
docker pull quay.io/canardconfit/puppeteer-docker
```

## Usage

You can use this image as a base image, or directly to run something. It was designed to do both.

Check out my project [is-academia-bot](https://github.com/CanardConfit/is-academia-bot) for an example of a base image.

## Features

- Pre-configured environment for Puppeteer on arm64 architecture.
- Includes version of Puppeteer and compatible Chromium versions.

## Dependencies

- Docker installed on your system.
- ARM64 architecture hardware.

## Building the Docker Image

You can build the Docker image from the Dockerfile if modifications are needed or if you prefer to build it locally:

> Please note that you must be on an arm64 machine or on a docker builder under arm64!

```sh
# If your host is under arm64
docker build -t your_custom_name/puppeteer-docker .

# If you are on amd64 for example, and you want to build
docker buildx build -t your_custom_name/puppeteer-docker:latest --platform linux/arm64 -- .
```
